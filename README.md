# Ping Pong Game Streamlit App

This Streamlit app embeds an interactive Ping Pong game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game adjusts to the size of the browser window, making it playable on both small screens (e.g., phones) and large displays.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a classic Ping Pong game directly within the app.
- **Responsive Design**: The game dynamically adjusts to fit your browser's window size.
- **Customizable**: Modify the `ping_pong.html` file to tweak the game's design, controls, or behavior.

## How It Works
The app uses Streamlit's `components.html` to embed the Ping Pong game into a Streamlit interface. The game logic and UI are handled entirely in the `ping_pong.html` file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit installed on your system. Install it via:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
  ```

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the provided `ping_pong.html` file in the same directory as the Streamlit app.
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Open the URL displayed in your terminal to launch the app.

## File Structure
```
├── app.py            # Streamlit app code
├── ping_pong.html     # HTML file containing the Ping Pong game
└── README.md          # Documentation for the app
```

## Customization
- **Game Settings**: Edit the `ping_pong.html` file to change colors, speeds, or other game configurations.
- **App Layout**: Modify the Streamlit app (`app.py`) to adjust the title, layout, or embedded frame dimensions.
